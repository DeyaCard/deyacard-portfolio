## Name of Student: Deya Card

## Name of Project: Deya's Space - A Digital Portfolio


### Project's Purpose or Goal:  
Present a retro styled (visualize MySpace) portfolio website for myself to share with potential employers or clients showcasing my web development skills. 

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* User will be able to connect to my social media networks
* User will be able to view galleries of images of my work
* 


### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* React 
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* NPM
* Firebase?


### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* Music player/streamer - or possible YouTube embedded music player.
* This application will be front-end heavy so if I have time I would like to dive into a database to sort user inputs. The website will mostly be static but it would be cool to expand it's functionality and show off my back-end skills. 


### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* A music API such as Spotify
* 


### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
* Not at this time.
